!!!tip "Are you looking for 1.x.x changelogs?"

    Prior to version 2.0.0, the changelogs were maintained **only in the** [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/kuvasz-uptime/kuvasz/releases){ target="_blank" }.

## 2.2.0 <small>2025-07-17</small> { id="2.2.0" data-toc-label="2.2.0" }

### Features

- **Metrics exporter settings** are exposed both on the API (under `GET /api/v1/settings`) and on the UI, so you can easily get an overview of the effective configuration.
- A **live demo** is available at [**demo.kuvasz-uptime.dev**](https://demo.kuvasz-uptime.dev){ target="blank" } where you can try out the latest features of _Kuvasz_ without setting up your own instance. Further details, credentials [**here**](demo.md).

### Fixes

- Fixed the glitch on the UI regarding read-only mode in case the underlying logic was initialized before YAML monitors were loaded. This caused the UI to not show the read-only mode correctly, even though the backend was working as expected.

## 2.1.0 <small>2025-07-11</small> { id="2.1.0" data-toc-label="2.1.0" }

### Features

- **Metrics exporters**: Added support for exporting metrics to _OpenTelemetry_ and _Prometheus_. See the [**Metrics exporters**](setup/metrics-exporters.md) section for more details. With this feature, you easily integrate _Kuvasz_ with your existing observability stack. Currently exposed metrics are:
    - Uptime status
    - Latest latency
    - SSL status
    - SSL expiry date
- **Bearer token authentication**: Added support for [**Bearer token authentication on the API**](features/api.md#authentication), along with the existing API key authentication. This allows you to use the same authentication mechanism as other modern APIs, making it easier to integrate with your existing systems.

## 2.0.0 <small>2025-07-02</small> { id="2.0.0" data-toc-label="2.0.0" }

### Breaking changes

- **Native image build logic has been removed**: Native images will not be supported in the future due to their higher level of unpredictability, and the achieved performance gain/resource saving in exchange is not so significant.
- **PostgreSQL 12+** is the minimum supported DB version.
- **The HTTP communication log has been removed**, because it was an unnecessary overhead in the network pipeline, and a built-in solution is also available now.
- **Authentication** has been fully reworked, read the [**Authentication**](setup/configuration.md#authentication) section for more details.
- The **latency data** (avg, p95, p99) of the monitors are not returned under `MonitorDetailsDto`, because a new endpoint is introduced for metrics like this under `/api/v1/monitors/{monitorId}/stats`
- (might be breaking, but not necessarily): SSL validation now takes **intermediate certs** into account
- The `DELETE /monitors/{monitorId}/pagerduty-integration-key` and `PUT /monitors/{monitorId}/pagerduty-integration-key` endpoints are gone, because the PATCH endpoint is now flexible enough to support both use-cases.

### Features

- **New Monitor attributes** (every default value also applies for the existing monitors):
    * `requestMethod`: `GET` or `HEAD`. The latter is generally faster, but be aware that certain targets might not support it (default `GET`)
    * `latencyHistoryEnabled`: `true` or `false`. If set to `false` latency will be not logged or returned in the monitors' metrics -> Better for a snappier experience on a slow machine (default `true`)
    * `forceNoCache`: `true` or `false`. If set to `true`, a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header will be sent with the request (default `true`)
    * `followRedirects`: `true` or `false`. If set to `true`, Kuvasz will follow redirects during uptime checks, and the last, non-redirected URL will be evaluated (default `true`)
    * `sslExpiryThreshold`: The number of days before the SSL certificate expires when a notification should be sent.
- **Option to disable authentication** (useful in a home-lab, for example) via `ENABLE_AUTH`. `true` or `false`, default `true`
- **Optimization of the check scheduling logic**: the first uptime check will be scheduled randomly between 1 second and the configured interval of the monitor to prevent hitting the HTTP client with a lot of requests right after the startup.
- **Optimization of the uptime checker**:
    * Made the error handling more robust by handling exceptions that come from invalid response format (e.g. invalid status code)
    * Increased the client's read timeout to 30s
    * Added support for non-absolute redirect URLs (a redirect location of `/path/something-else` on `https://example.com` will be resolved as `https://example.com/path/something-else`
    * Detect and avoid redirect loops
- **Improvement of the `DOWN` event's error formatting** both for showing and saving it. Non-visible/printable characters, and long response errors are now sanitised and might be redacted. If the uptime check fails with a standard HTTP status code and a standard error response, then the HTTP status and its name will be the error's "label" (e.g. `403 Forbidden`)
- Initial (i.e. **if there is no previous state for a given monitor**) UP & VALID states of uptime & SSL checks are not sent to RTC & SMPT event handlers to prevent sending irrelevant notifications upon the first startup
- The **latency metrics** calculation logic **has been optimized** to handle large datasets efficiently
- âœ¨A brand-new **Web UI** has been introduced, which is more modern, responsive, and user-friendly
- Monitors are configurable via a **YAML file** besides the UI and the API ("_infrastructure as code_" way)
- Exposed `nextUptimeCheck` and `nextSSLCheck` on the API
- Made `sslValidUntil` persisted on the SSL events, and exposed it on the API
- `sslExpiryThreshold` is configurable now on a per monitor basis
- Uptime & latency data retention are separetely configurable now
- Made the whole project translatable (the only language set up is English, as of now, but future translations are already super-easy)
- Monitor filtering on the API was greatly improved with new filters: `enabled: Boolean?`, `sslCheckEnabeld: Boolean?`, `uptimeStatus: UptimeStatus[]?` and `sslStatus: SSLStatus[]?`
- App and integration settings are exposed now both on the UI and on the API (under `GET /api/v1/settings`)
- Added more latency metrics to `GET /api/v1/monitors/{monitorId}/stats`: min, max and p90
- The integration setup has been completely reworked, making it smarter and more flexible. From now on, you can set up **multiple integrations per type** (Slack, E-mail, etc.) in your YAML config. Then you can make them global (that is in effect for all your monitors without further configuration), or **you can assign them on a per monitor basis**.

### Chore
- Simplified and streamlined the things around jOOQ
- Simplified the logging configuration by moving it to Micronaut's own config file
- Changed the base image to `liberica-runtime-container:jre-17` and reduced the compressed image size by ~23%
- Build `arm64` images too
- Bumped the 3rd party dependencies to their latest versions
- Use Java 21
- Switched to a multi-module project layout (should have done it at the beginning ðŸ¤¦ )
- Switched to kover from JaCoCo

The **full changelog** is available on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/kuvasz-uptime/kuvasz/releases/tag/2.0.0)
